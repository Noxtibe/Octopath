# Octopath

Personal project on Unreal with C++.
 
My intention was to recreate the Octopath Traveler combat system.

Here's what I've managed to implement :

- A working turn based system waiting for each actions for each entities
- A simple attack, defense & flee options
- The defense option place the player at the first place of the next turn
- A skill menu to unleash customizable abilities vie data assets in the editor (like the number of target, physical/magical type, buff/debuff affecting stats, damage, cost...)
- Displaying the name of the character with infos like health, technique point & more
- 2 order action bar to visualize the order of the actual turn and the next one
- Feedback on enemies when selected by an abilities (displaying name and make them flash slowly)
- Some VFX for the attacks
